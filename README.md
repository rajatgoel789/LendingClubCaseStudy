## General Information
- The objective of analysis is to use the information about past loan applicants and find whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- People with more number of public derogatory records are having more chance of filing a bankruptcy. Lending club should make sure there are no public derogatory records for borrower.
- The variables that we considered in this analysis are not good predictors for loan status prediction. Because there is a significant difference in the parameter estimates when we split the original data into training data and validation data. Also, there is collinearity problem among the variables that we selected. So, further investigation is required along with the selection of other significant predictors.
- Small business loans are defaulted more. Lending club should stop/reduce issuing the loans to them.
- Borrowers with mortgage home ownership are taking higher loans and defaulting the approved loans. Lending club should stop giving loans to this category
